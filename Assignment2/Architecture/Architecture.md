# C4 Model

C4 is a modeling and documentation language developed to express architecture in a powerful way. The C4 model consists of Context, Container, Component and Code level diagrams. In the C4 Model, each level represents a different level of abstraction and it is possible to zoom from the highest abstraction to more detailed one. Thus, you can communicate with stakeholders at different technical levels through different diagrams.

## Level 1: System context diagram
Level 1, a system context diagram, shows the software system you are building and how it fits into the world in terms of the people who use it and the other software systems it interacts with.

### Purpose: 
To provide a high-level overview of the system and its interactions with external entities.
### Elements:
Shows the system in scope, external users (actors), and other systems that interact with it.
### Audience: 
Non-technical stakeholders, such as project sponsors and business analysts.
