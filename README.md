## Tez Yatra
Tez Yatra is an online platform that helps people get from one place to another quickly and conveniently. Instead of waiting for a bus or looking for a taxi on the street, you can use Tez Yatra to book a ride right from your phone. 
Tez Yatra is designed to make traveling around your city easier and more efficient by leveraging modern technology to connect passengers with drivers.

## How It Works:

### Choose Your Ride: 
You can select from different types of vehicles like bikes, cabs, or auto-rickshaws, depending on what you need and how much you're willing to spend.

### Book a Ride: 
Open the Tez Yatra app or website, enter your pickup location and destination, and request a ride. The app will show you the available vehicles nearby.

### Get Picked Up: 
A driver will accept your request and come to pick you up at your specified location.

### Travel to Your Destination: 
Sit back and enjoy the ride to your destination. You can track your ride in real-time on the app.

### Pay for Your Ride: 
You can pay for the service through various methods, such as cash, credit/debit cards, or digital wallets, depending on what the app supports.

## Benefits of Tez Yatra:
