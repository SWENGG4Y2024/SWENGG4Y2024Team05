## **Constraints and assumptions:**

**Constraints:**
1) Network Connectivity: The functionality of the Tez Yatra app depends on a stable internet connection. 
   Users in areas with poor network coverage or limited access to mobile data may experience difficulties 
   in booking rides or accessing real-time updates, impacting their overall experience with the app.
2) Device Compatibility: The full functionality of the Tez Yatra app may vary depending on the user's 
   device. Older smartphones or devices with outdated operating systems may not support the latest 
   features or updates of the app, limiting the user's experience and access to certain functionalities.
3) Geographical Limitations: Tez Yatra's services may not be available in all geographical locations. 
   Users in areas where Tez Yatra does not operate may be unable to access the app or book rides, 
   restricting their ability to utilize the platform for transportation needs.
4) Payment Methods: The availability of payment methods may vary depending on the user's location. Users 
   without access to credit/debit cards or mobile payment options may face challenges in making payments 
   for their rides, impacting their ability to use the app effectively.
5) Vehicle Availability: The availability of Tez Yatra rides may be limited during certain times or in 
   specific locations, depending on factors such as driver availability and demand. Users may experience 
   longer wait times or difficulty in finding rides during peak hours or in areas with lower demand for 
   transportation services.

 ##  **Assumptions:**
1) Driver Availability: The effectiveness of the Tez Yatra app assumes the availability of drivers willing

   rides.
2) User Availability: The Tez Yatra app assumes that users are available and ready to book rides when

3) Internet Connectivity: The Tez Yatra app relies on a stable internet connection to function optimally.

   rides, make payments, and receive real-time updates. In cases where users face interruptions in 
   internet connectivity, their ability to use the app effectively may be compromised.
4) Safety Measures: The Tez Yatra app assumes that users and drivers adhere to safety guidelines and 
   regulations during rides. While safety features such as real-time ride tracking and SOS alerts are 
   provided within the app, their effectiveness depends on users and drivers following safety protocols
